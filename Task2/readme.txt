Given bracket sequence: [((())()(())]]
Can this sequence be considered correct?
If the answer to the previous question is “no”, then what needs to be changed in it to make it correct?

No, this sequence isn't correct 'cause there is closed bracket "]" that don't have an open one and open bracket "(" that don't have closed.
